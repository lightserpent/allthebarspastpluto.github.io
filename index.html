                <i>All The Bars Past Pluto</i> is an improvised comedic sci-fi radio drama starring the vocal talents of Ellie Sternitzky, Chris Mithel, Ethan Bell, Maya Henry, Connor Daniels, Sonia Lester, and Gus Mitchell. It’s the far future, and the galaxy-wide shipping company, Starport, needs ships and crew transporting goods around the solar system. Enter the Flying Belvedere, a cargo ship that’s been repurposed more times than you can count, and her crew, an eager bionic navigations expert, an aloof and forgotten deity, a phantom of an unorthodox avocado farmer, and their new captain an out-of-her-element young woman who joined the crew on a dare. After being sucked into a space anomaly on their first mission transporting goods to Pluto, our intrepid travelers are deposited on the other side of the galaxy. Now this motley crew must work together to find their way home through an often strange and alien galaxy, and of course, stop at all the bars along the way.
